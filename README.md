Welcome to **Avati** ‚Äî a thoughtfully crafted toolkit designed to empower developers in building and shipping high-quality UI widgets and packages with ease. The mission is to provide tools and libraries that follow the best practices, ensuring a smooth development experience while maintaining top-tier code quality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Project in Development
Avati is currently in the development phase. While many tools are functional, the project is under active development and subject to changes. Expect frequent updates and improvements as I refine the tools and add new features.

I appreciate your understanding and patience during this phase. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, your feedback is invaluable in shaping Avati.
## Vision

Avati is built with a clear focus on:

I believe in enabling developers to focus more on innovation and less on reinventing the wheel.
